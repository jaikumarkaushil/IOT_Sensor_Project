## IoT Sensor Project - Temperature and Humidity Detection
This project is an IoT-based solution designed to monitor temperature and humidity using sensors.

### Project Overview
The IoT Sensor Project is designed to accurately measure and report the temperature and humidity in a given environment. This data can be used in various applications, from home automation to industrial monitoring and control.

### Hardware Requirements
- IoT Device (like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.)
- Temperature and Humidity Sensor (like DHT11, DHT22, etc.)
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard (optional)
### Software Requirements
- IoT platform software (like MicroPython Arduino IDE, Raspberry Pi OS, etc.)
- MQTT Broker (like Mosquitto, HiveMQ, etc.) for data communication
- Database for data storage (like InfluxDB, MySQL, etc.)
- Dashboard for data visualization (like Grafana, Freeboard, etc.)
### Installation and Setup
1. Connect the temperature and humidity sensor to your IoT device as per the sensor's datasheet.

2. Install the necessary software on your IoT device. This typically involves setting up the IoT platform software and installing any necessary libraries for the sensor.

3. Write the code to read data from the sensor and publish it to the MQTT broker. The specifics of this will depend on your IoT device and sensor.

4. Set up the MQTT broker to receive data from the IoT device.

5. Set up the database to store the received data.

6. Set up the dashboard to visualize the data.

### Running the Project
After setting up, run the IoT device's software to start reading data from the sensor and publishing it to the MQTT broker. The broker will forward this data to the database, and you can view it on the dashboard.
